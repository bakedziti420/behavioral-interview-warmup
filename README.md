# Behavioral Interview Warmup

Remember the STAR/PTAR method for answering behavioral interview questions?  Today, we will practice this method.  

## The Prompt

Tell me about a time that you had to solve a difficult problem, *with code*.

## The Exercise

Developers will pair up and take turns trying to answer this prompt.

While one developer is answering the question, the other will be taking notes for at least two "Glow"s and "Grow"s.  The note-taker should try and structure their comments arount the **PTAR** method.  

- **P**: Does the interviewee do a good job describing the **problem**?
- **T**: Does the interviewee do a good job describing the **task**?
- **A**: Does the interviewee do a good job describing the **approach**?
- **R**: Does the interviewee do a good job describing the **results**?

## The Reason

It is impossible to prepare for every interview question, and many of them are very open-ended, so we are giving you an opportunity to think on the fly about this fairly vague prompt in a low-pressure environment.
